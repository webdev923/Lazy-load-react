# react-lazyload [![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/react-lazyload.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/js/react-lazyload)

Lazyload your Components, Images or anything matters the performance.

[Online Demo](//jasonslyvia.github.io/react-lazyload/examples/)

## Why it's better

 - Take performance in mind, only 2 event listeners for all lazy-loaded components
 - Support both `one-time lazy load` and `continuous lazy load` mode
 - `scroll` / `resize` event handler is debounced so you won't suffer with frequent update
 - IE 8 compatible

## Who should use it

Let's say there is a `fixed` date picker on the page, when user pick a different date, all components displaying data should send ajax request with new date parameter to retreive updated data, even many of them aren't visible in viewport. This makes server load furious when there are too many requests in one page.

Using `LazyLoad` component will help ease this situation by only update components in viewport.

## Usage

```
import React from 'react';
import LazyLoad from 'react-lazyload';
import MyComponent from './MyComponent';

const App = React.createClass({
  render() {
    return (
      <div className="list">
        <LazyLoad>
          <MyComponent />
        </LazyLoad>
        <LazyLoad>
          <MyComponent />
        </LazyLoad>
        <LazyLoad once >        /* Once this component is loaded, LazyLoad will
                                   not care about it anymore, stuff like images
                                   should add `once` props to reduce listeners for
                                   scroll/resize event and improve performance */
          <MyComponent />
        </LazyLoad>
        <LazyLoad offset={100}> /* This component will be loaded when it's top
                                   edge is 100px from viewport. It's useful to
                                   make user ignorant about lazy load effect. */
          <MyComponent />
        </LazyLoad>
        <LazyLoad>
          <MyComponent />
        </LazyLoad>
      </div>
    );
  }
});

React.render(<App />, document.body);
```

## Props

### once

Type: Bool Default: false

Once the lazy loaded component is loaded, do not detect scroll/resize event anymore. Useful for images or simple components.

### offset

Type: Number Default: 0

Say if you want to preload a module even if it's 100px below the viewport (user have to scroll 100px more to see this module), you can set `offset` props to `100`. On the other hand, if you want to delay loading a module even if it's top edge has already appeared at viewport, set `offset` props to negative number will make it delay loading.

### scroll

Type: Bool Default: true

Respond to `scroll` event, this is default behaviour.

### resize

Type: Bool Default: false

Respond to `resize` event, set it to `true` if you do need LazyLoad listen resize event.

**NOTICE** If you tend to support legacy IE, set this props carefully, refer to [this question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1852751/window-resize-event-firing-in-internet-explorer) for further reading.

## Props added to children

Like the example above, `<MyComponent>` will get following extra props:

### visible

Type: Bool

Is component currently visible

### firstTimeVisible

Is component first time visible, useful for children component's `componentWillReceiveProps` detect whether or not should query new data.
